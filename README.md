This is a remix of the new "pawless" logo for firefox to keep it minimalist while adding the paw back. Related to the following [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/dmny7m/here_is_a_logo_that_will_satisfy_probably_most_of/). Fell free to use this logo for anything you want (if you want you can mention me somewhere in the comment but this is public domain so do whatever).
